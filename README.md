# 🌞 Solar Potential Analysis: Benin, Sierra Leone & Togo

This project is part of a 10 Academy data challenge focused on analyzing solar energy potential across three West African countries: **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo**. The goal is to use cleaned solar irradiance datasets to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize trends, and provide insights that could guide solar energy development.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Load and clean solar irradiance datasets
- Profile and explore data for each country
- Compare solar potential across the three countries
- Visualize monthly and overall irradiance trends
- Provide insights into optimal regions or months for solar projects

 📊 Key Features

- Time series plots of solar irradiance
- Histograms of irradiance distributions per country
- Correlation heatmaps (optional)
- Monthly average comparisons of irradiance across countries
- Modular, reusable Python code for loading, profiling, and visualizing data

 📈 Visual Examples

- 📉 Time Series: Solar irradiance trends over time
- 📊 Distribution Plots: Understand typical irradiance levels
- 🌍 Cross-Country Comparison:Monthly average irradiance trends

🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:


   git clone https://github.com/nbeany/solar-potential-analysis.git
   cd solar-potential-analysis


2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  


3. Install required packages:


   pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:


   jupyter notebook
 

 🧪 Dependencies

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* jupyter

> You can install all of them using the `requirements.txt`.

 📌 Insights & Recommendations

* Benin shows high solar potential during dry months.
* Sierra Leone has more variability, suggesting potential seasonal challenges.
* Togo demonstrates consistent performance with a slight increase in certain months.

These findings can help prioritize regions and timing for solar installations.
